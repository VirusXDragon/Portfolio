        <h1>What is Anime?</h1>
        <p> Anime is hand-drawn and computer animation originating from Japan. In Japan and in Japanese, anime (a term
            derived from the English word animation) describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin.
            However, outside of Japan and in English, anime is colloquial for Japanese animation and refers specifically
            to animation produced in Japan.[1] Animation produced outside of Japan with similar style to Japanese
            animation is referred to as anime-influenced animation. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production methods that have adapted in response to emergent
            technologies. It combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and
            individualistic techniques. Compared to Western animation, anime production generally focuses less on
            movement, and more on the detail of settings and use of "camera effects", such as panning, zooming, and
            angle shots. Diverse art styles are used, and character proportions and features can be quite varied, with a
            common characteristic feature being large and emotive eyes.</p>
