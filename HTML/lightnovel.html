        <h1>What is Anime?</h1>
        <p> A light novel (ライトノベル, raito noberu) is a style of Japanese young adult novel primarily targeting high
            school and middle school students. The term "light novel" is a wasei-eigo, or a Japanese term formed from
            words in the English language. Light novels are often called ranobe (ラノベ) or, in English, LN.[citation
            needed] The average length of a light novel is about 50,000 words, close to the minimum expected for a
            Western novel, and they are usually published in bunkobon size (A6, 10.5 cm × 14.8 cm), often with dense
            publishing schedules.
            <br><br>
            Light novels are commonly illustrated in a manga art style, and are often adapted into manga and anime.
            While most light novels are published only as books, some have their chapters first serialized in anthology
            magazines before being collected, similar to how manga is published. </p>
